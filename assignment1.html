                PROCESS OVERVIEW <br>

                <br>
                In order to best to approach the problem I sketched out solutions based around two criteria. <br>
                The first being one piece of the kit must be used at least 12 times. <br>
                The Secondary objective was personal, I wanted to create an asset that that i could return to later for future exploration, possibly during the Final project. <br>

                    Laser Cuts off about .01 so in order to create a press fit; male ends must be +.01 inches bigger than the female ends as they should be -.01 shorter

                Tanya helped me understand how much the the laser was cutting off (.01") which helped me better gauge my tolerances.
