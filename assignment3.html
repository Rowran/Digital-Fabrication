                    Design prompt criteria: <br>
               <li> Criteria #1: Make a lamp using both laser cut and 3D printed parts. 
                <li> Criteria #2: Imagine your lamp being in a domestic setting---perhaps it will not be wildly shaken, but it should not fall apart with normal use. </li> 
                <li> Criteria #3: Consider Form and Function </li>
                <li> Criteria #4: </li>

                <p> 
                    The first thing i did was seek out inspiration online and brainstormed ideas. <br>
                    <img src="Images/Inspiration.jpg"  width=400> 

                    <br> In the sketch below,  I explored how University of Washington's Logo could be integrated into a lamp. <br>

                    <br> 
                    After considering the time it would take to manufacture the prototype, I pivoted away from this design in addition to considering the after considering the value proposition created by the function for the end user.

                    Utilizing Solidworks and Illustrator I prioritized Rapid prototyping speed over diving deeper into Learning Rhino <br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully I utilized my time more efficiently than last few projects. <br>
                     The laser cut pieces were measured for the most part correctly, requiring only a handful tweaks to create a press fit.

                    <h3> Problem: </h3>
                    The largest issue with this project was getting a 3D printer to work correctly.  
                    I used two different printers before finally finding a third working printer that would lay down fillament correctly.

                    <h3> Solution: </h3>                 
                    
                    My solution to this issue was to try every troubleshooting in the book. From changing printers to tweaking the model, to buying new filament. Sometime the hardware
                    <br>                   
                    For example, when I look at a 2D image to consider it's 3 dimensions, I slice it in half and consider how I would get this outcome if I was subtracting the material. <br>
                    With Visual Diagrams in Grasshopper, one has to break down the model into small dimensions which make up the components from the ground up.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p> 
                In hindsight, I should have split the 3D printed model in half to reduce time to print. <br>
                That way I could have started printing two 6 hour prints instead of one 12 hour print.   
                <br>
