                    Design prompt criteria: <br>
                <li> Criteria #1:  Design and fabricate a mold in silicone. </li>
                <li> Criteria #2:  Use the mold to cast at least 4 identical parts (e..g in plaster). </li> 
                <li> Criteria #3:  Design your master part in CAD first, then design your mold, then design a mold to cast your mold in.   </li>
                <li> Criteria #4:  Fabricate your mold's molds either by CNC milling machinable wax or by 3D printing. </li>


                <h2> Ideation / Develop </h2>
                <p> 
                    <br> For this weeks project, I started off by considering making a mold with a functional purpose. 
                    <br> Considering that fathers day is coming up, I decided that a Sextant mold would entertain my father and he could use it as a business asset. 
                    <br> After I tried making a Sextant, I decided to keep it  it simple so I downloaded a Sextant to act as the detailed model inside the Positive Mold.

                       As per usual with Digital Fabrication, tweaking the models and the output is a necesarey portion of the process.
                       <br> Initially I focused on learning the software to design my mold, utilizing Onshape for the Mold Base then Fusion 360 for the Sextant Model and for the assembly. 
                       <br> This process enabled me to become much more familiar with Fusion 360. <br> 
                       For example I learned how to convert the Stl models from Thingiverse using the Mesh to Bbodies function.
                       <br> <br> The original plan was to   learn more about subtractive cutting  with Fusion 360, and the CNC tooling system. 
                       <br> So I became familiar within the different modes such as Manufacturating adding new operations like manual tool changes between 3D milling operations.

                    <h3> Problem: Creating the Mold</h3>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p>   
                        The plan was to cut the primary body of wax with a 1/8th" bit followed by a 1/32" bit to cut the intracies of the Sextant. <br> 
                        However the projected cut time was acround 6+ hours. <br> 
                        <br> 
                        I iterated by switching over to 3D printing for quicker and more reliable results. <br>
                        This was the right decision but It create it own set of issues <br> 
                        One Problem that I encountered with 3D Printing was that their was a kill point in the model's Gcode causing the print to cut itself off at a point. 
                        <br> What I believe happened in the design was that in the Manufacturing tool mode I had a manual tool change operation. <br> 
                        <br> This bug was the primary reason why it failed two times. On the third print, the reel jammed causing a misprint. Fourth time the charm. <br>

                <p>
                  In the end the 3D printing enabled me to get the mold. 
                  With all of the extra prints, I had a two part mold and

                    In hindsight, my joints were to simple compared to the advanced techniques. 
                     However teaching others is an extremely helpful way to learn and I managed to onboard 6+ people to the tooling process which in turn aided myself in becoming extremely familiar with the machines and settings.
